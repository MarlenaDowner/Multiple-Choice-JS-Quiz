# Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to replicate a task which is sometimes given to interviewees as part of and a coding assessment. Thus testing my skills within JavaScrpt as if I am the interviewee.

This mini project is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app run's in the browser, and feature's dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

The coded quiz contains the following criteria::

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
